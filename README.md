# SAR_imaging_implementations
This project focuses on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging algorithms and implementations. In the first stage, we will realize four parts: point target simulation and matched filtering, CS imaging algorithm, RD imaging algorithm, and implement a motion compensation algorithm; I will add other contents if I have time.
